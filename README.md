# swift-app

1. Open the `xcodeproj`
2. Resolve Swift packages.
3. Build an run.

Create a UI that fetches and presents data from a REST api.  The data layer has been implemented already, just wire it up.  There are Youtube links in some of the data structures, have the videos playable in some form in the UI (in addition to any photos etc.).
